title: Getting Setup

### What to bring

**Bring your [personal laptop]{.text-danger} and a power cord.**
This is going to be a hands-on workshop, meaning that you’ll be writing code and collaborating with new friends you’ll make at the workshop. 

We’ll be using [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud) ([details below](#using-posit-cloud)), so you don’t need to set up anything on your computer.

## Create Accounts

In this workshop, we'll be using a few different online services.
If you don't already have accounts with these services, you'll need to create them before we get started.

* [Posit Cloud](#using-posit-cloud)

* [GitHub](https://github.com/join)
  * Used to login to the Posit Connect instance set up for this workshop.
  * Did you know? You can use your GitHub account to log in to Posit Cloud, too!

* [Discord](https://discord.com/register)
  * Used to communicate during the workshop and ask questions via text. Also used for general online participation during the conference.
  * Make sure your [display name](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/12620128861463-New-Usernames-Display-Names#h_01GXPQABMYGEHGPRJJXJMPHF5C) is the one you used to register for the conference.
  * Closer to the conference start, you'll be able to join the `posit::conf(2024)` Discord server via the event portal at <https:://posi.it/conf-event-portal>.
  * Our workshop channel is [`#workshop-level-up-shiny`]({{< meta workshop.links.discord >}}).


## Using Posit Cloud

::: {.callout-note title="Recommended Workflow"}
The easiest way to get started is to use the Posit Cloud workspace I've prepared for you.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
<!-- FIXME cloud link: remove note -->
The link to join the space is not yet available.
This page will be updated on the day of the workshop.

You will need a Posit Cloud account and you can create one for free at [posit.cloud/plans](https://posit.cloud/plans).
Click "Learn more" under the Free plan to sign up.
:::

I've prepared a Posit Cloud workspace for workshop participants with a project for you to use during our time together.
The project contains all of the files and packages pre-installed and ready to go.
All you need to do is log in and start coding!

If you already have a Posit Cloud account, first [join the level-up-shiny space on Posit Cloud]({{< meta workshop.links.cloud >}}).
Otherwise [sign up for a free account](https://posit.cloud/plans) and then join the space.
You can create an account with your email or login with Google, GitHub or Clever.

Once you're part of the [level-up-shiny space]({{< meta workshop.links.cloud >}}), select the `level-up-shiny` assignment to create and launch a new project just for you.

## Using Your Own Computer

::: {.callout-caution title="Advanced Workflow"}
**This is not the recommended workflow.** I recommend [using the Posit Cloud workspace](#using-posit-cloud) to avoid having to set everything up yourself.

That said, if you prefer to use your own computer, it's entirely possible.
:::

If you prefer to use your own computer, you can [clone the repository]({{< meta workshop.links.repo >}}) and install the necessary packages.
I used [R 4.4](https://r-project.org) but any recent version of R (>= 4.1) should work.

You can use the [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org) package to quickly clone the repository:

```r
usethis::create_from_github(
  "posit-conf-2024/level-up-shiny",
  # Decide where to put the project here:
  destdir = "~/Desktop/level-up-shiny"
)
```

This will download the repository and open the project in RStudio.

### With renv

Inside the project, use the `renv` package to install the necessary packages:

```r
renv::restore()
```

For very speedy installation, I recommend telling renv to use [pak](https://pak.r-lib.org/) to install packages:

```r
Sys.setenv(RENV_CONFIG_PAK_ENABLED = "true")
renv::restore()
```

### Without renv

Sometimes `renv` can be a little tricky to get set up.
Fortunately, there's an alternative installation method that should work just as well.

First, disable `renv`:

```r
renv::deactivate()
```

Then install use [pak](https://pak.r-lib.org) to install the necessary packages:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::local_install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)
```

Or with [remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org):

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)
```

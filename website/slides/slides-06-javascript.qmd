# The ðŸ¤– in the Room {.middle}

## 

* Have you ever used a large language model like ChatGPT?

* Have you used an LLM to help you write code?

* Have you used an LLM to help you learn a programming language?

* Have you used an LLM to write a Shiny app?

* Have you used an LLM to write a workshop about Shiny?

## 

* What do LLMs do best?

* When do LLMs perform poorly?

## Our Task

We want to update our college comparison app to remember the colleges
that the user was comparing.

We've decided that [bookmarking](https://mastering-shiny.org/action-bookmark.html)
is too involved, 
we just want the app to remember automatically.

## Your Turn {.slide-your-turn}

1. I had [a conversation with ChatGPT](../workshop-06-chat.qmd) about this task. \
   **What strategy does the ðŸ¤– suggest?** Find:

   * the browser JavaScript API
   * the Shiny JavaScript API
   * where to put this JavaScript code in our app
   * the server-side logic that connects JS &harr; R

2. What made my prompt to ChatGPT **effective**?

## Live Code Together

1. Use the chat to give our comparison app a memory.

2. What works about the prompt? What strategies did I use to increase the chances I'd get a useful response?
